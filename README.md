## Lisa's Final Portfolio

* Current markup is at http://byshieldmaiden.github.io
* Mockup is images/teamtreehousemockup.png and images/teamtreehousemockup-2.png
* Portfolio will also live at http://lisa.wtf

### Idea
To create a landing page with a browser width header, social media links
in the right top corner and left bottom corner (github / team treehouse / email / ?), navigation bar, and sticky footer.
In the main content area, I was thinking of three or two columns with the 
far left column being the about and the next two using two or three rows 
per column to showcase already completed projects with a listing of
technologies used when you hover over the image. An example of a mockup
project is https://byshieldmaiden.github.io/kate/ which was created with html,
css, is responsive, I created the image and did the design.

(I have approached a few friends who need simple website design projects
to do those projects for them to illusrate breadth of skills.)

I have no idea what to do for framework and other than the hover over
the project images, interactivity.

Help. Please.

### Update February 27, 2017
Figured out how to create nested flexboxes and have been working on 
getting the design somewhat hammered out. Found **another** site to work 
for my overall porfolio, which brings the list up to **five**.

It would also be helpful if I actually **referenced** the right files
when pushing back to my repository. :100:
