## Lisa's Final Portfolio

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to showcase other design and front end
web development projects I have done. These projects will range from single
page static sites to multipage dynamic sites. 


* Current markup is at http://byshieldmaiden.github.io
* Mockup is images/teamtreehousemockup.png and images/teamtreehousemockup-2.png
* Portfolio will also live at http://lisa.wtf

### To Run
Head to http://byshieldmaiden.github.io which will execute the 
index.html file. When loaded, the jQuery call to Flickr will bring up current images from my personal
Flickr feed that have the tag "pug"


### Mockup Idea
To create a landing page with a browser width header, social media links
in the right top corner and left bottom corner (github / team treehouse / email / ?), navigation bar, and sticky footer.
In the main content area, I was thinking of three or two columns with the 
far left column being the about and the next two using two or three rows 
per column to showcase already completed projects with a listing of
technologies used when you hover over the image. An example of a mockup
project is https://byshieldmaiden.github.io/kate/ which was created with html,
css, is responsive, I created the image and did the design.

(I have approached a few friends who need simple website design projects
to do those projects for them to illusrate breadth of skills.)

I have no idea what to do for framework and other than the hover over
the project images, interactivity.

Help. Please.

### Update February 27, 2017
Figured out how to create nested flexboxes and have been working on 
getting the design somewhat hammered out. Found **another** site to work 
for my overall porfolio, which brings the list up to **five**.

It would also be helpful if I actually **referenced** the right files
when pushing back to my repository. :100:

### Update March 1, 2017
Added social icons and linking to Twitter, GitHub, and Treehouse. Not
sure about adding any others. Adding more to my to do list. Still working
on beating flexbox into submission. Will probably have to restart the layout
from scratch but I have a better idea of what I'm doing.
